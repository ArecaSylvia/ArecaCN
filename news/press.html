			</div>
			<div class="modal-body">

				Taipei, Taiwan January 04, 2021 - <br>
				<p>Areca Technology Corporation (ARECA), a leading provider of internal RAID controller, Thunderbolt storage solutions, external RAID controller and PCIe RAID adapters with RAID 6 inside, today announced the new ARC-1886 series offer advanced technology for enhanced performance and improved enterprise data protection. They were designed with 1.6 GHz dual core ROC processor, DDR4-2666 memory architecture and PCIe 4.0 interface for the most performance-hungry database and IT applications. <strong>Based on the ARM A15 PCIe 4.0 x8 to SAS/SATA/PCIe RAID on Chip (ROC) controller, the ARC-1886 series RAID adapters can offer both PCIe Gen 4.0 host and 12Gb/s SAS/SATA/PCIe (NVMe) tri-mode storage interfaces.</strong></p>

				<p>The whole series adapters default support on-board 8GB of ECC DDR4-2666 SDRAM memory. The optional cache backup module, ARC-1886-CBM, provides cache offload capability to protect cached data in case of system power loss.

				<p><strong>NVMe Performance Gains for Fast Data</strong></p>

				<p>Based on the ARM A15 x8 PCIe Gen 4.0 to SAS/SATA/PCIe RAID on Chip (ROC) controller, the ARC-1886-6N2I RAID adapter raises the standard to higher performance levels with several enhancements including a new high performance 1.6 GHz dual core ROC processor, a DDR4-2666 memory, outstanding performance PCIe Gen 4.0 host and 12Gb/s SAS/SATA/PCIe (NVMe) interface bus interconnection. The RAID adapter by default supports on-board 8GB of ECC DDR4-2666 SDRAM memory. The ARC-1886-6N2I, providing an extremely fast, reliable, and ultra-compact solution for companies that need storages, is especially designed and featured in the high-speed data recording and processing.</p>

				<p>The ARC-1886-6N2I dynamically allocates storage PCIe 4.0 lanes to NVMe slot1 and SAS/SATA ports to get best performance – for professional media workstation and server environments designed to support high-speed data recording and processing. This RAID adapter can back up to 6 NVMe on just one full high PCIe adapter, increasing the capacity/speed as more NVMes are added to it. The ARC-1886-6N2I supports both 2280 and 22110 form factor drives and combines them on a tri-mode RAID adapter to maximize I/O performance for database applications and streaming digital media environments. Damage in a software RAID is considered as the consumption of massive computation and memory bandwidth on the host. The ARC-1886-6N2I hardware RAID relieves the parity generation burden from the host and maximizes application processing performance.</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<p><strong>Guaranteed Data Protection</strong></p>

				<p>In Areca’s high-performance RAID solution, ARC-1886-6N2I brings PCIe NVMe to a superior performance hardware RAID at an elevated throughput, high IOPs and a low latency. It supports the hardware RAID 6 engine and allows two devices failures without impacting the existing data and performance. The ARC-1886VN provides a dual disk arrays including a NVMe disk array and a SAS/SATA hard disk array. The 6 PCs NVMe are for extreme speed purpose (8K uncompressed video data editing, Gaming.. etc), then use 2 SAS/SATA HDD as storage area. The RAID firmware will have a special mode to preset the value and back up the data of M.2 NVMe disk array to the SAS/SATA port hard disk array when the host workload level does not reach the preset value. This has the advantages of fast access to data by the NVMe disk and scores high reliability of data storage on the hard disk.</p>

				<p>The ARC-1886-6N2I off module power loss protection (PLP) is optimized for datacenter environments. Its efficient PLP typically applies the capacitors on the NVMe SSD to provide hold-up power until the data is flushed from the NVMe internal DRAM to the NAND flash upon a sudden power off or any failure condition occurrence. The ARC-1886-6N2I utilizes the optional CBM module to provide off module hold-up power, eliminating the need for capacitors on the NVMe SSDs which helps reduce cost. The optional CBM module or on-board battery (CR2032) supporting M.2 slot will show a fault LED status and easily be identified as a failed drive when it is removed from the system PCIe slot. Controller based hardware encryption manages any kinds of drives attached to ARC-1886-6N2I adapter without impacting the performance for higher levels of security.</p>

				<h4 class="modal-title">Areca Releases Linux Driver for ARC-8050T3 Thunderbolt RAID Storage</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="modal-body">
				Taipei, Taiwan May 10, 2018 - <br>
				<p>Areca Technology Corporation (ARECA), a leading provider of internal, external and Thunderbolt RAID storage, today announced the availability of Linux driver for fully lines of Thunderbolt 3 ARC-8050T3 SAS/SATA RAID storage. Areca ARC-8050T3 RAID storages are already compatible with Windows PCs and Mac machine and now it is also compatible with Linux PCs.</p>

				<p>Our linux driver in the kernel does not work with ARC-8050T3 hotplug. From Linux Raid driver source v1.40.00.05, it can support thunderbolt cable hotplug. This new driver source patch will be integrated directly into the Linux kernel to replace the existed kernel ArcMsr driver source, allowing future versions of Linux operating systems to default support Areca's entire family Thunderbolt RAID storage.</p>

				<p>The source code patch for Areca's Linux drivers will be released as part of all new Linux kernels, and is also available on the company's web site at <a href="https://www.areca.com.tw">https://www.areca.com.tw</a>. Being part of the standard Linux kernel means that Areca's new driver source code patch will be included in all the future Linux distributions, including Red Hat, SuSE, OpenLinux, Debian, and Ubuntu.</p>

				<p>The Thunderbolt Linux code today consists of kernel and daemon components that extend the capabilities of firmware-based Thunderbolt systems. Linux kernel 4.13 or later has provided really strong Thunderbolt suspend/ resume function. The daemon software components operate in coordination with the upstream Thunderbolt kernel driver (found in v4.13) to provide the Thunderbolt functionalities. The daemon is not compatible with the old out-of-tree Thunderbolt kernel module. Users need to add the Thunderbolt daemon on the linux environment which is similar as Windows Thunderbolt driver for thunderbolt M/B to enable the thunderbolt functionalities. You need to upgrade your kernel to version v4.13.13 or higher for the daemon user-space components.</p>

				<h4 class="modal-title">Areca Adds RAID Controller Firmware New Advanced Configuration</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="modal-body">
				Taipei, Taiwan April.13, 2018 - <br>
				<p>Areca Technology Corporation (ARECA), a leading provider of internal, external and Thunderbolt RAID controllers, today announced the enhanced configuration features in the new version firmware. This new enhanced features include RAID 1-Multi Mirroring and Mirrored Pass-Through Disks that delivery a truly innovative hardware triple disks mirror solution.</p>

				<p>Usually RAID 1-Simple Mirroring uses just two disks in a mirror. A third disk in the mirror set would permit active double-redundancy like with RAID-6, but without the overhead of parity generation, so better performance at lower cost. You can set up a RAID 1-Multi Mirroring or Mirrored Pass Through three disks system so that it mirrors data onto three identical disks all mirrored. If you combine an SSD and HDDs in a Mirrored Pass-Through, RAID1-Simple Mirroring or RAID 1-Multi Mirroring hybrid solution, the reads are obtained from the SSD with SSD speed. You don’t need to use OS and/or Software to create the copies of your data across multiple drives.</p>

				<strong>RAID 1-Multi Mirroring</strong>

				<p>RAID 1-Multi Mirroring is also known as “triple disk mirror”; data written on one disk drive is simultaneously written to another two disk drives. Read performance will be enhanced if the array controller can, in parallel, access all members of multi mirrored drives. During writes, there will be a minor performance penalty when compared to writing to a single disk. If one or two drive fails, all data (and software applications) are preserved on the healthy drive. RAID 1-Multi Mirroring writes three copies of everything, but its data storage capacity effective is 33.3%.</p>

				<strong>Mirrored Pass-Through Disk</strong>

				<p>Pass-through disks are attached to a RAID controller and operate as if they were attached to a non-RAID controller. No RAID configuration structure is stored on these physical disks. This feature is primarily targeted for users moving physical disks containing data from non-RAID controllers to RAID controllers. The disk is available directly to the operating system as an individual disk. It is typically used on a system where the operating system is on a disk not controlled by the RAID controller firmware. A mirrored pass-through disk means controller will be regarded as the hard disk clone function, a host’s data will write simultaneously into dual or triple hard disks in the RAID controller. Triple pass-through means “save three copies of the data such that you can survive two disks failure and still have everything.”</p>

				<h4 class="modal-title">Areca Introduces SED Technology on RAID Controllers</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="modal-body">
				Taipei, Taiwan May. 30, 2016 - <br>
				<p>Areca Technology Corporation (ARECA), a leading provider of internal RAID Controller and external RAID controller, today announced a new firmware embedded with SED technology for their RAID controllers. A SED (or Self-Encrypting Drive) is a type of hard drive that automatically and continuously encrypts the data on the drive without any user interaction. The SED encryption is easy to use and manage with minimal impact on RAID controller performance that is invisible to the user, does not interfere in their workflow.</p>

				<p>The SED function secures a volume's data from unauthorized access or modification in the event of drive theft, as well as more routine activities such as the return of defective drives for servicing or the decommission or repurposing of drives. The contents of a SED are always encrypted and the encryption keys are themselves encrypted and protected in hardware that cannot be accessed by other parts of the system. Local key management in the controller is designed to protect data from security breaches with minimal cost and complexity.</p>

				<p>SEDs do all the cryptography within the disk drive internal controller, which means the disk encryption keys are never present in the RAID controller or memory, where they could be accessed by hackers. Encryption will conceal your volume's data and make accessing the files almost impossible for anyone who does not know your key. With this scramble process, no one can see and access into the hidden volume data without access key.</p>

				<p>The new embedded SED function firmware is now available for the 6Gb/s and 12Gb/s SAS RAID controller.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="modal-body">
				Taipei, Taiwan November 27, 2014 - <br>

				<p>Areca Technology Corporation (ARECA), a leading RAID manufacturer of internal, external and Thunderbolt RAID controllers, today announced launching their RAID firmware version 1.52 date: 2014-11-20 and later has supported a firmware level HDD Xfer Speed test.</p>

				<p>“Hdd Xfer Speed” is a firmware-level hard disk / SSD speed function that is used to measure the drive's performance. “Hdd Xfer Speed” will perform read tests without overwriting customer data. The read-only palimpsest benchmark of the disk is shown in the device information. If the value drops below the normal curve, something may be wrong with the disk. User can use “Set Disk To Be Failed” function from remote side to set a slow speed disk as “failed” so that volume will be not stuck by the slow speed disk after rebuild.</p>

				<p>“Hdd Xfer Speed” result can be accessed by clicking on the “Device” from the “RAID set Hierarchy” you wish to scan, clicking on the “Show Result”. This allows you to set up a scan environment which runs the test by clicking “Test Disk Speed” on the right screen setup option. If more than one drive is checked when you set the ‘Disks To Be Tested”, it will run that test for the number setting drives.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<p>If there's a certain location in the hard drive that is getting poor performance, hard drive read benchmarks can help confirm this. Above is a screenshot of a palimpsest benchmark on a hard drive. The length time of firmware takes to complete the drive test depends on its size.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="modal-body">
				Taipei, Taiwan, January 8, 2013 - <br>

				<p>Areca Technology Corporation (ARECA), a leading provider of internal RAID Controller, external RAID controller andPCI-X/PCIe RAID adapters with RAID 6 inside, today announced that its second-generation ARC-1882 6Gb/s PCIe 3.0 SAS RAID adapters have featured with controller based hardware encryptionfunction.Controller based hardware encryption describes the encryption of data occurring at the disk array controller before being sent to the disk drives.Since RAID controller is a natural central point of all data therefore encryption at this level is inherent and also reduces deployment complexity.ARC-1882 RAID controller has dedicated electronic circuitry for the cryptographic engine embedded in the ROC and operating at full channel speeds. The hardware encryption does not impact the performance of ARC-1882 RAID controller and can implement on any kinds of HDDthat is transparent to the user, the OS, and applications.</p>

				<p>Areca encryption function secures a volume's data from unauthorized access or modificationin the event of drive theft, as well as more routine activities such as the return of defective drives for servicing or the decommission or repurposing of drives.Local key management in the controller is designed to protect data from security breaches with minimal cost and complexity. User can use ARC-1882 RAID controller API code to design their own key management utility.</p>

				<p>Encrypting your volume can give your data an extra layer of protection be­­yond setting up a controller password. Encryption will conceal your volume's data and make accessing the files almost im­­possible for anyone who does not know your encryption key.Data saved in the volume will be hidden by Algorithm developed by Areca Technology. With this scramble process, no one can see and access into the hidden volume data without access key.</p>

				<h4 class="modal-title">Areca Announces Family Cost Effective SAS Host Adapter</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="modal-body">
				Taipei, Taiwan, February 19, 2009 - <br>

				<p>Areca Technology Corporation, a leading provider of internal RAID adapters and external RAID controllers, today announced the availability of a new series SAS host adapter. The host adapter card enables large-scale direct attach storage (DAS) arrays through external 3Gb/s ports, driving up to 128 end-point devices for Min SAS connector or driving up to 16 SATA devices for eSATA connector. The host bus adapter drives external server storage RAID and non-RAID enclosures with unprecedented throughput by connecting a four-lane 2.5 Gb/s PCI Express bus with option one external x4 SFF-8088, one internal x4 SFF-8087 and two external x4 SFF-8088/four internal x4 SFF-8087 miniSAS connectors.</p>

				<p>Areca SAS host adapters are able to connect to both SATA and SAS hard disk drives, allowing for tiered storage that optimizes costs and performance. SAS drives are optimal when speed and reliability are of the utmost concern, while SATA drives are appropriate when capacity and cost are more important. Areca offers a diverse selection of SAS host adapter including a wide variety of internal and external connector configurations to support any application, from high-performance workstations to large-scale DAS arrays at low cost concerns. System integrators can use the Areca host adapter to build large-scale storage array infrastructures that support both SAS and SATA devices. The cost savings can be felt immedi­ately when using the ARC-1300 to develop a tiered storage solution with hard disk drives (HDDs), tape drives, tape autoloaders, solid state drives (SSDs) and removable media (DAS/JBOD).</p>

				<p>Areca ARC-1300 series support broad operating system including Windows® 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, Windows 2000, Red Hat Linux (Open Source), SuSE Linux, FreeBSD, Mac and Solaris along with enclosure management features such as LED header, and SES2/SGPIO (ARC-1300ix-16) function. All OS drivers are backed by extensive testing and validation to ensure optimum system perfor­mance. Those products and technology are based on extensive testing and validation process; leverage Areca engineer more than fifteen years SCSI host adapter experience.</p>

				<p>The new Areca ARC-1300 host adapter is shipping and available through worldwide distributors and resellers now.</p>

				<h4 class="modal-title">OpenSolaris Adds Areca SAS and SATA ll RAID Controller Drivers in Its Kernel Tree</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="modal-body">
				Taipei, Taiwan, November 5, 2008 - <br>

				<p>Areca Technology Corporation (ARECA), today announced that its SAS and SATA RAID driver have been integrated directly into the Opensolaris build 99 (and later), allowing future versions of Opensolaris operating systems to support Areca's entire family of SAS and SATA ll RAID controllers out of the box.</p>

				<p>PSARC/2008/079 (arcmsr SAS/SATA RAID driver) introduces arcmsr(7d) on the x86 and x64 platforms, to support the Areca technologies SAS and SATA RAID cards. Installing Solaris to arcmsr-attached storage directly is supported, along with use of arcmsr for dump devices. The driver also introduces the distribution constructor to the package repository.</p>

				<p>Areca Technology Corporation (ARECA) had announced that its PCI-X SATA ll RAID controller has supported Solaris 10on Sep. 17, 2005.Areca added the driver to it’s fully series PCI-X/PCIe RAID controllers. This will enable the SATA ll RAID function into the SUN application.</p>

				<p>In the early days, we ported many device drives to SCSI host adapter and IDE/SCSI cache controller including Solaris X86 operating system. After accumulating years o Solaris 8 device drive experiences, Areca is capable of writing its own Solaris 10 device drives. This driver smoothes the path for customers who consider a move to Solaris X86 platform. Areca engineers have experienced in providing SAS and SATA RAID drivers to the Linux community for several years. But, for the first time, is now having its RAID drivers embedded in the OpenSolaris. The release of new open-source drivers enables developers to create and share new drivers for Areca controllers. We provide our driver source code under the CDDL or a BSD/MIT-style license.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="modal-body">
				Taipei, Taiwan, October 24, 2008 - <br>

				<p>Areca Technology Corporation (ARECA), today announced that their CLI version 1.82_81103 and firmware version 1.46 and later supports the <b>“Store RAID Configuration”</b>, allowing customer using the Areca's entire family PCI-X and PCI-Express series of high performance SATA and SAS RAID controllers and need of a way to keep the RAID configuration.</p>

				<p>Areca got a suggestion from many customers who wanted to take a screen shot of his present configuration and later on shuffle hard drives in his enclosure. Unfortunately, they had to click on each slot individually to get drive's Serial Number information. Since his suggestion is very useful as it would allow to match a S/N to a port the drive was connected to. Sometimes, when a RAID set has to be re-created with the "NO INIT" option, this info would help to restore original drive order in that RAID set which is important for such procedure.</p>

				<p>The CLI will keep two kinds of information to a file. If you would like to record these settings, such as raidset/volume configurations, system configuration and drive information, you can use the cli command to record them to a text file. The CLI also support the CLI command to record RAID system configuration to a binary file, you can restore it to synchronize different controllers with same RAID system configuration. Please refer to CLI manual on the website to use those two new commands: Savecfg and Save BIN/Restore/Bin.</p>

			<div class="modal-body">
				Cebit Hannover Germany, March 4, 2008 - <br>

				<p>Areca Technology Corporation (ARECA), a leading provider of internal, external and PCI-X/PCIe SAS or SATA ll RAID controllers with Intel RAID 6 inside, today announced that its 4-bayeSATA Host RAID Box (ARC-5020). The eSATA host port unleashes the power of 3Gbps and NCQ on the eSATA host port.</p>

				<p>The 4-bay RAID box offers a truly innovative eSATA (3Gbps)/USB2.0 solution for use with your PC and Mac. Designed and leveraged with Areca’ existing high performance solution, this controller delivers high-capacity performance at the best of cost/performance value.With RAID technology, it allows one HDD failure without impact on the existing data and failed drive rebuild is transparent to the host. The Intelligent cooling continuously adapts to environmental conditions by automatically controlling the speed of the cooling fans. This super silent design, optimizing balance between noise reduction and necessary cooling, help the resellers to offer the cost effective storage solution to the end customers.</p>

				<p>ARC-5020 hardware RAID box unleashes the power of 3Gbps performance and NCQ support on the eSATA host port. The eSATA port delivers in excess of 220 MB per second (MB/sec) sustained RAID 0 reads and over 210 MB/sec RAID 0 sequential writes. The result is superior overall performance compared to other 4 bay eSATA solution. High transfer rates make ARC-5020 well suited for audio/video application especially the rapidly growing demand from the Mac Video Editing markets. With the host SATA controller supported port multiplier function, both eSATA and USB2.0 host channel can support multiple volumes (up to 4) by Areca’s target mode multiplier emulation. The RAID controller provides RAID levels 0,1, 10, 3, 5, Single Disk or JBOD RAID configurations.Areca greater than 2TB support allows for very large volume set application in 64-bit environment such as data-mining and managing large databases.</p>

				<p>Manual configuration and monitoring can be done through the LCD Control Panel, RS-232 and LAN port. The LCD Hot-Key supports one-step easy RAID configuration to simplify the firstly setup of RAID controller. The controller firmware also contains a browser-based McRAID storage manager that can access through the on board LAN port.</p>

				<h4 class="modal-title">Areca Releases First Family 8/12/16/24 internal and 4 External Ports SAS RAID Controllers</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="modal-body">
				Cebit Hannover Germany, March 4, 2008 - <br>

				<p>Areca Technology Corporation (ARECA), a leading provider of internal RAID Controller, external RAID controller and PCI-X/PCIe RAID controllers with Intel RAID 6 inside, today announced that its first family ARC-1680ix PCIe SAS RAID controllers have featured with 8/12/16/24 internal port and 4 external port SAS connectors. The family controllers can leverage with the existing 8/12/16/24-port SATA enclosure available from chassis providers such as Advanced Industrial Computer, Chembro, Ci Designs and TST.</p>

				<p>The SAS RAID controllers raise the standard to higher performance levels with several enhancements including Intel new high-performance 1200MHz IOP348 I/O Processor, a DDR2-533 memory architecture and PCIe x8 Link host interface bus interconnection. ARC-1680ix-12/16/24 series include one DIMM socket with default 512MB of ECC DDR2-533 SDRAM with optional battery backup module, upgrade to 4GB. The ARC-1680ix-8 low profile board default supports 256MB on-board memory.The SAS interface supports both SAS disk drives for data-intensive applications, and Serial ATA (SATA) drives for low-cost bulk storage of reference data. Applications that benefit most features from these controllers include NAS, server RAID solutions, supercomputing, near-line backup, web servers, security systems and streaming applications.</p>

				<p>The SAS RAID controllers can also provide RAID levels 0, 1, 10, 3, 5, 6, 30, 50, 60, Single Disk or JBOD for maximum configuration flexibility. The SAS RAID controller supports broad operating system including Vista/2003/XP/2000, Linux (Open Source), FreeBSD (Open Source), Solaris (Open Source), Mac and more, along with key system monitoring features such as enclosure management(SES2, SMP & SGPIO) and SNMP function. The Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard has included the driver on its kernel tree. Our products and technology are based on extensive testing and validation process; same as Areca SATA ll RAID adapter field-proven compatibility with operating systems, motherboards, applications and device drives.</p>

				<p>Normally, customers need to add one separated SAS expander board or backplane with SAS expander to meet the high port count enclosure. They need different backplane or other expander board occupied one extra slot comparing the currently SATA solution. Since the SAS expanders handle the compatibility of disk belonged the expander, user needs to get the support from both the SAS RAID adapter and expander board vendors. Areca ARC-1680ix series have integrated the expander on the controller to meet sever RAID vendors without worrying the compatibility. User can support up to (128) SAS/SATA ll peripheral devices using the external 4 port.</p>

				<h4 class="modal-title">Areca Has Supported the ATA-8 Spec for WD Microcode Download</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="modal-body">
				Taipei, Taiwan, November 21, 2007 - <br>

				<p>Areca Technology Corporation (ARECA), today announced that their SAS and SATA ll RAID firmware version 1.43 Date: Feb 2007 (and later)has supported the ATA-8 spec for microcode download, allowing customer using the Areca's entire family PCI-X and PCI-Express series of high performance SAS and SATA ll RAID controllers. This functuin will perform as a system level when update WD HDD's firmware without necessary removing any single drive and upgrade.</p>

				<p>The current way to upgrade the HDD microcode is pull out the drives from the RAID system and insert the drives into a PC with SATA port. Either running under windows 2003, or maybe booting up with a DOS bootable CD to upgrade all the drives one by one while drives are in the unit. It takes much time to update the all RAID system drives firmware. If the system has the same mode HDDs, it will update all same modes HDD Microcode once. This function has co-worked with WDC and has verified on their latest WDC ATA-8 microcode download supported HDD. Areca has provided one utility for customer to make the WD firmware for readable by Areca firmware.</p>

				<p>Here are the steps to update the HDD microcode that is same as our firmware upgrade.</p>

				<p>
					1. Transfer WD firmware code to Areca firmware readable code.<br>
					2. Under "System Controls" menu selected "Upgrade Firmware"<br>
					3. Chose the firmware files that you provided back to us (locally stored on c:\)<br>
					4. Checked "confirm" box
				</p>

				<p>The update is in progress will take 50 seconds. It is extremely important that the user cant not remove power or interrupt the update in progress or the drive can be rendered useless.</p>

				<p>Areca PCI-X and PCI-Express SATA RAID controller comes in 4-, 8-, 12-, 16 and 24-port configurations, but it promises to be much faster and to boast other improvements than competitors, such as RAID 6, SAS and SATA ll support. The new controllers are designed to support the 64-bit computing applications. They support single volume set greater than 2TB via 64-bit LBAs on one controller. </p>

			</div>
			<div class="modal-body">
				Taipei, Taiwan, November 16, 2007 - <br>

				<p>Areca Technology Corporation (ARECA), today announced that their SAS and SATA ll RAID driver has been integrated directly into the Red Hat 4.6 (and later), allowing future versions of RHEL operating systems to support Areca's entire family PCI-X and PCI-Express series of high performance SAS and SATA ll RAID controllers.</p>

				<p>Areca drivers were officially merged in the 2.6.19 Kernel tree. Areca RAID controller drivers have been out Linux for a while already, it is actually irritating our customer that Red Hat does not provide included our driver. Our controllers perform even better than any other rival SATA raid card in the market. Customer current uses Areca cards running RHEL4.5 or previous version and updating a kernel is a pain since users also have to go through the extra step of manually building and installing the driver.</p>

				<p>Now, after Red Hat has included a back ported patch Areca 2.6.19 driver on the update 1 releases of RHEL5 which bases on the kernel 2.6.18-53.e15. Today Red Hat once again has included a back ported patch Areca 2.6.19 driver into the update 6 releases of RHEL4 which bases on the kernel 2.6.9-67.EL. That means Areca fully series 4-, 8-, 12-, 16-, 24-port SAS and SATA RAID controller works on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.6 without an additional driver for the kernel. Now, the operating systems from the following version beginning have included Areca PCI-X and PCI-Express 4-, 8-, 12-, 16-, 24-ports SAS and SATA RAID controller comes in their kernel.</p>

			<div class="modal-body">
				Taipei, Taiwan, November 13, 2007 - <br>

				<p>Areca Technology Corporation (ARECA), today announced that their SAS and SATA ll RAID controllers driver can work properly with the Fedora 8 (and later) kernel driver, allowing future versions of Fedora operating systems to support Areca's entire family 4-, 8-, 12-, 16-, 24-port series of high performance SAS (ARC-1680 series) and SATA ll (ARC-11xx/12xx) RAID controllers.</p>

				<p>Fedora is a Linux-based operating system that showcases the latest in free and open source software. Fedora isalways free for anyone to use, modify, and distribute.Areca drivers were officially merged in the 2.6.19 Kernel tree. Areca driver has integrated into the Fedora 7 which has based on the kernel 2.6.22.4-65.fc7. But, the Fedora Unity Project has a critical issue to enable Areca kernel driver installation and this bug has not been fixed in that edition.</p>

				<p>If you use FC7 x86_64 edition, you need to download our installation driver disk to install system into Areca volume. But, the FC7 i386 standard edition kernel doesn't accept both Areca kernel GPL driver modules and installation driver. You will not be able to install this Linux edition into Areca volume.</p>

				<p>The Fedora Unity Project found the issue and has fixed the original bug on the FC8. Now you will be able to install OS into Areca fully series 4-, 8-, 12-, 16-, 24-port SAS and SATA RAID controller volume without adding any driver or patch on the new released FC8 edition.</p>

It is including all Linux distributions, such as Red Hat, SuSE, TurboLinux, Debian, and Mandrake that use 2.6.19 Kernel tree or newer will automatically support the Areca fully family controller hardware. Areca RAID controllers driver have been out Linux for a while already, it is actually irritating our customer that Red Hat does not provide included our driver. Our controllers perform even better than any other rival RAID cards in the market.</p>

				<p>Customer current uses Areca cards running RHEL5 (based on the 2.6.18 kernel) and updating a kernel is a pain since users also have to go through the extra step of manually building and installing the driver. Now, Red Hat has included a back ported patch Areca 2.6.19 on the Update 1 releases of RHEL5 which is running the kernel-2.6.18-53.el5. That means Areca fully series 4-, 8-, 12-, 16- and 24-port SAS and SATA RAID controller works on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.1 without an additional driver for the kernel. Since CentOS is a freely-available Linux distribution that is based on Red Hat's commercial product: Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL),Areca driver will officially merge into the CentOS 5.1.</p>

				<p>Areca PCI-X and PCI-Express SATA RAID controller comes in 4-, 8-, 12-, 16 and 24-port configurations, but it promises to be much faster and to boast other improvements than competitors, such as RAID 6, SAS and SATA ll support. The new controllers are designed to support the 64-bit computing applications. They support single volume set greater than 2TB via 64-bit LBAs on one controller.</p>

				<h4 class="modal-title">Areca Releases Solaris 10 Driver for PCI-X/PCIe SATA ll RAID Controllers</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="modal-body">
				Taipei, Taiwan, September 21, 2005 - <br>

				<p>Areca Technology Corporation, a leading provider of PCI-X, PCI-Express SATA ll RAID controllers with Intel RAID 6 inside, today announced that its PCI-X SATA ll RAID controller has supported Solaris 10. In response to the Linux competition, Sun has renewed its commitment to selling Solaris servers for the X86 platforms. Last year, SUN <a href="http://news.com.com/Sun+plans+server+with+AMDs+Opteron/2100-1006_3-5104444.html?tag=nl">partnered with AMD</a> to develop servers based on AMD's Operton 64-bit processor. Sun is also developing software called Janus for <a href="http://news.com.com/Suns+Solaris+10+to+run+Linux+apps,+too/2100-7344_3-5295908.html?tag=nl">running Linux applications on Solaris</a>. Areca has added the driver to it’s fully series PCI-X/PCIe RAID controller. This will enable the SATA ll RAID function into the SUN application.</p>

				<p>Solaris 10 was released in February 2005, although the pre-release had been tested for some time. Solaris 10, like later versions before it, is supported on both SPARC and x86 architectures, and both 32-bit and 64-bit CPUs. </p>

				<p>Sun long has been wedded to its own UltraSparc processors, and Solaris has rarely been used elsewhere. Now Sun is aggressively boosting the operating system on x86 chips such as Intel's Xeon and Advanced Micro Devices' Opteron. SUN has been predicting recently that Solaris and its accompanying development tools will be increasingly of interest to developers writing software for x86 servers-that is, those running more mainstream processors from Intel and Advanced Micro Devices.</p>

				<p>In the early days, we had ported many device drives to SCSI host adapter and IDE/SCSI cache controller including Solaris X86 operating system. After accumulating years of Solaris 8 device drive experiences, Areca is capable of writing its own Solaris 10 device drives. This driver smoothes the path for customers who consider a move to Solaris X86 platform.</p>

				<h4 class="modal-title">Areca Releases In-band Manager for its External RAID Controllers</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="modal-body">
				Taipei, Taiwan, June 30, 2005 - <br>

				<p>Areca Technology Corporation, a leading provider of External RAID controller, PCI-X, PCI-Express SATA ll RAID controllers with Intel RAID 6 inside, today announced that its fully lines controller has supported In-Band manager through PCI, SCSI and Fibre channel bus.</p>

				<p>The originally Areca external RAID controller only offers several out of band options for easy configuration and management. These out-of-band managements include via an RS-232 through industry standard terminal communications applications and over LANs through an Ethernet port. The external RAID controller now can also be managed in-band over SCSI or Fibre Channel bus. One of the most attractive in band management features of the Areca RAID controller is Areca's embedded Application Programming Interface (API) which provides third party OEMs and integrators with the means needed to develop their own management tools including Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) Utilities.</p>

				<p>When we implement an in-band storage network, both data and manager flow over the same path. In an out-of-band implementation, the data flow is separated from the manager flow. Separating the flow of manager and data in this manner allows the data to use the full bandwidth of SCSI or Fibre channel bus, while manager could go over a separate network in the RS232 or LAN that are isolated for this purpose.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="modal-body">
				Taipei, Taiwan, May 28, 2005 - <br>

				<p>Areca Technology Corporation, a leading provider of internal PCI-X, PCI-Express SATA ll RAID controllers with Intel RAID 6 inside, today announced that its PCI-X SATA ll RAID controller has featured with external Infinband connectors. ARC-1110ML and ARC-1120ML controller together with the external enclosure available from chassis providers, bringing the high performance and more features to external storage needs instead of relying on the traditional need of USB or 1394 interfaces.</p>

				<p>Initially PCI-X SATA ll RAID controller was designed as an internal or inside-the-box interface technology, bringing improved performance and new features to internal storage. Areca quickly realized the innovative interface could reliably be expanded outside the PCs or Macs, with specifically defined Infinband cables, and Infinband connectors.</p>

				<p>The current PowerMac G5 has two internal S-ATA drive bays which are fine for RAID 0 and 1. Mac OS X Supports Raid levels 0 and 1 in software which of course takes some processing power from the machine. Since Mac users are quite used to external peripherals one might think about an external enclosure where you could fit in several S-ATA drives and have the cables wired through the slot-blade to the external drive enclosure. This is surely a good solution for professional Mac users (eg. video applications, audio, DVD authoring, etc.) as well as in the small server sector. Areca ARC-1110Ml/1120Ml is ideally suitable for this kind of Mac users at an affordable price.</p>

				<p>The 24-port SATA ll RAID controller is designed for storage subsystem and supports up to twenty-four hot-swappable hard disk drives. It is included around the worlds leading technology Intel RAID 6 inside. This controller supports Intel RAID 6 inside function, which can be critical for increasing data availability by providing important disaster recovery function.</p>

				<p>Normally, 24-port enclosure needs two 12-port SATA RAID controllers. User creates individual RAID set for each controller. The operating system stripe both of two controller’s raid sets. Two controllers occupy two PCI slot and have its private parity disk. ARC-1170 supports 24-port SATA ll RAID controller. User can create raid set using 24 disks. It only occupies one PCI-x slot and one set of parity disk.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="modal-body">
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>Highest performance RAID 6 in Industry</li>
						<li>SATA II 300 Gbps speed at all SATA II drive ports</li>
						<li>Tolerates two disk failures simultaneously without losing data</li>
						<li>Supports greater than 2TB per volume set and battery backup module</li>
						<li>Firmware-embedded Web Browser-based RAID manager, SMTP manager, and SNMP agent via LAN port with no software required in the 12-/16- port controller</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				Taipei, Taiwan, October 27, 2004 - <br>

				<p>Areca Technology demonstrated the PCI-Express/PCI-X to SATA RAID host adaptors, the industry's highest speed RAID 6 at Intel Developers Forum China and Taiwan held Oct 14-15 in Shenzhen, China and Oct 25-26 in Taipei, Taiwan, respectively.</p>

				<p>The Areca PCI-X and PCI-Express SATA RAID controller comes in 4-, 8-, 12-, and 16-port configurations, but it promises to be much faster and to boast other improvements than their competitors, such as RAID 6, and SATA ll support. The new controllers are designed to support upcoming 64-bit computing applications. They support single volume set greater than 2TB via 64-bit LBAs on one controller. The Areca Series controllers are designed to protect the customer's investment in RAID. It offers online capacity expansion, RAID level Migration, Battery Backup Module, redundant flash image and enclosure management services via an integrated I2C bus. All those features come from its field-proven external RAID controller.</p>

				<p>As storage capacities continue to increase rapidly, users need a greater level of disk drive tolerance. RAID 1 can provide greater fault tolerance, but it requires costly double disk drives on large volume sets. Users want the security of RAID 1 or better with an implementation cost similar to RAID 5. RAID 6 can offer fault tolerance greater than RAID 1 or RAID 5, while only consuming the capacity of two disk drives designated for the distributed parity data.</p>

				<p>Areca has been leading industry technology for about 2 years, successfully developing the RAID 6 engine in Asia, which can tolerate two simultaneous drive failures without downtime or data loss. By implementing the RAID 6 engine, the RAID controllers see no performance sacrifice in multitasking environments. The new Areca RAID 6 engine is supported on its PC-X and PCI-Express SATA RAID controller and is also available in all its external RAID controllers. Customers who want to accommodate increasing disk drive capacities coupled with the lower performance and reliability metrics associated with some disk technologies such as ATA/SATA need powerful, high-performance, fault-tolerant protection found in RAID. As ATA /SATA drive densities reach 320GB and beyond, conventional parity protection techniques such as RAID 5 decrease in their calculated effectiveness, and RAID 6 technology becomes an essential ingredient to deliver enterprise-level availability. Assuming 500 GB drives, NetApp engineers calculate that, without dual parity, 5% of RAID rebuilds would fail. NetApp also ships the double-fault function as the default setting on its NearStore line of low-end filers. Intel will have the RAID 6 engine in its next generation 80331/80332 IOP processors.</p>

				<p>The 12- and 16- port controller firmware also embeds the following features:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>The firmware contains Web Browser-based RAID manager that allows local or remote accessfrom any standard web browser via a LAN or WAN with no required software or patches.</li>
					<li>The firmware contains SMTP manager monitors that all system events and users can select where either single or multiple user notifications can be sent via "Plain English" e-mails.</li>
					<li>The firmware-embedded SNMP agent allows remote monitoring via LAN with no SNMP agent required.</li>
				</ul>
