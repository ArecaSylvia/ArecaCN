	<meta name="description" content="ARC-1264il internal PCIe 2.0 host RAID controllers are the cost-effective solutions for connecting 12/16 6Gb/s SATA peripherial devices. The 12/16 ports combine low-cost SATA III and port multiplier chips with low latency for internal storage systems. The 12/16 ports are aimed at high-availability and capacity oriented applications more than 8 HDDs, such as security systems, surveillance, multimedia content generation, large-volume data capturing, mail servers and entry-level database systems. The 12/16 ports RAID controllersâ€™ performance is limited by the port multiplier and HDD numbers. Applications will get the best performance when you attach the max number HDDs on the RAID controller or rearrange the HDD position to use max port multiplier chip. They can support directly attached 12/16 internal 6Gb/s SATA ports via 3/4 SFF-8087 connectors." />
