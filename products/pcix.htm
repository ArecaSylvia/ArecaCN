	<meta name="description" content="The ARC-11X0 Serial ATA ll RAID host adapter is a high-performance PCI-X bus to SATA ll Disk Array host adapter. The controller can provide up to 4 or 8 SATA ll peripheral devices on a single host adapter. When properly configured, the SATA host adapter can provide non-stop service with a high degree of fault tolerance through the use of RAID technology and advanced array management features. Intel IOP331 processor has integrated the RAID 6 engine inside. It offers Areca the advantage of reduced engineering and development costs, by having the New RAID6 function build-in and integrated part saves on component costs and internal PCI bandwidth. Intel emphasis on architectural commonality in IOPs allows Areca developers to capitalize on their existing code base. The 4 and 8 port SATA RAID controllers are low-profile PCI cards, ideal for 1U and 2U rack-mount systems. These controllers utilize the same RAID kernel that has been field-proven in Areca existing external RAID controllers, allowing Areca to quickly bring stable and reliable RAID controllers to the market." />
